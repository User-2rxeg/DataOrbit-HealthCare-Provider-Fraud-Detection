# DataOrbit Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection

A small repository for detecting potential fraud in healthcare provider billing using machine
learning and data analysis. This commit updates the README as a placeholder so we can
exercise making a change and pushing to `main`.

- **Repository:** `DataOrbit-HealthCare-Provider-Fraud-Detection`
- **Status:** Placeholder README (docs update)
- **Next steps:** Add data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation notebooks.

If you want, I can now add a starter `requirements.txt`, a sample notebook, or CI configuration.

## Contributing
